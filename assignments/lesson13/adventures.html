                        A slightly more fast pace trip touching on some white waters towards the end. There is very
                        little risk of fall out, so don't worry, you can have fun even if you don't know how to swim.<br>

                        This course is hard and fast paced. Though the same length as our other rivers, the waters move
                        faster so the trip will be shorter. This will be less about enjoying the scenery and more about
                        enjoying the ride. There will be a trainner there with you to ensure everyones safety.<br>
                        Length: 2 hours.<br>
                        Skill: Advanced.<br>
                        Cost: 100 per person.<br>
                        Lunch is included in this package at the end of the ride as you rest by the fireplace in our own
                        lodge (because you will be cold and wet by the end!)
