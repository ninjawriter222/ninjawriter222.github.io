              While there is an element of risk, there is no need to worry.  We've never had a fatality, or even had to evacutate someone via helicopter, but that doesn't mean it can't happen.  We have rivers that range from difficult to easy, and one must have a certain amount of years rafting before participating in a more dangerous river trip.  That doesn't mean you can't come and have fun rafting though!  In addition we always have trained medical personnel on hand, ready to assist in any way if needed.

              The excursions are priced differently based on what river you decide to raft on.  Some are afternoon excursions while others are 2 days trip, returning on the second day.  We provide all necessities however. (Sleeping bag, foam pads, tents, backpacks, food, rafts, the whole 9 yards.)  You shouldn't need to bring anything but yourself, clothes you can get wet in, and swimming shoes.

              We allow anyone to come rafting with us, even young children.  Some people might be worried that their children would be bored on a 3 hour raft ride, however, I've never seen a bored child rafting before as rafting in and of itself is an amazing adventure!  Especially with natures beauty surrounding you, children of all ages love rafting with us!
