                <h2>PARC: PROXMITY</h2>
                <h3>Slick Deals</h3>
                <a href="www.slickdeals.com" target="_blank"></a>
                <img src="images/Slickdeals.PNG" alt="Slickdeals Homepage">
                <p>I feel like slickdeals uses the proximity principal very well as It has a good balance to all the
                    spacing that it has. You can easily tell where the beginning and end of each deal is but still has
                    good spacing on the ads. In this way you can tell their meant to be part of the website and a part
                    to be read, but still seperate. </p>

                <h2>PARC: Alignment</h2>
                <h3>Reddit</h3>
                <a href="www.reddit.com" target="_blank"></a>
                <img src="images/Reddit.PNG" alt="Reddit Homepage">
                <p>It's a little hard to tell from the home page, but I felt that Reddit did a great job of using
                    alignment because it is easy to read throught he different comments and posts by their vertical
                    posting method.</p>

                <h2>PARC: Contrast</h2>
                <h3>Amazon</h3>
                <a href="www.amazon.com" target="_blank"></a>
                <img src="images/Amazon.PNG" alt="Amazon Homepage">
                <p>I felt like this had a great example of contrast right here on the front page. Just by looking at it
                    your eyes are drawn to the dark image of the bumblebee ad. This is vastly different from the rest of
                    the page which has white backgrounds so you can better see the items within which are
                    described/advertised</p>
